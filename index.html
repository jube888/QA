        <h3>Software Quality Assurance</h3>
        <p>I entered the QA world in 2006 while working at UPS-SCS in Oakville Ontario. Another fellow employee had left our department for a QA Analyst role,
        and when I asked her about it, everything she told me was exactly what I wanted. I worked hard to get noticed, and when a new QA Anaylst job role was posted,
        I jumped right on it. I impressed the hiring manager, and was hired. The role was amazing and I flourished. Eventually I moved on from UPS-SCS to other QA roles,
         and most recently into a senior position with my current employer.</p>

        <h3>Multi-Tasking</h3>
        <p>I am a professional multi-tasker. I always have way more on my plate than the regular person, and I am able to navigate through everything
        to make sure I keep on top, and get everything completed, with the highest quality, and on time.</p>
